This discussion should focus on the procedure of creating a new company. I would prefer it to be focused on the Greek standards/laws, but it would be very interesting if we could do a short comparison with other countries as well.

Questions I believe we should answer are the following:

    What is a start-up?
    What is a spin-off?
    How do you start?
    How do I get funding?
    What if they "steal" my idea?
    Do I need to be knowledgeable in management, marketing, and other "unrelated" to software development skills?
    How do I recruit the first and most valuable people?
    Can I do it?
    What are the risks?
    What do I lose in the case of a failure?
