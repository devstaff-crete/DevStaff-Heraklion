# DevStaff intro presentation
The `slides-devstaff-intro.html` file contains the intro presentation of the DevStaff's meetup in an open format. We use [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) as the engine behind the presentation.

The presentation was originally set up using the free plan of [slides.com](https://slides.com/).

## Using the presentation

This presentation can be used by just downloading the `slides-devstaff-intro.html` file and opening it using a browser.

`Caution`: The first slide contains a template for the agenda of each meetup so it has to be edited before using it.

## Edit the presentation using a text editor

The presentation can be edited by using a simple text editor. The agenda slide can be easily edited using this way or can even be ignored in some cases.

## Edit the presentation using [slides.com](https://slides.com/)
