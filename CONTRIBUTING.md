# Contributing Guidelines

DevStaff is an open community for developers in Crete. We want everyone to be able to contribute!

## Meetup Topics

The DevStaff Meetups take place every 2nd Thursday of each month (except August) and the subject is picked by the Org Team. 

Here's how that works:
* The Org Team gets together every so often (in [Org Meetups](https://github.com/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion#org-meetups) ) where we determine the next topics, depending on speaker availability.

One of the hardest problems for all meetups is to find speakers, so we welcome any proposals and may prioritize such topics for scheduling. 

You may notice there are :thumbsup: icons on several GitHub issues that propose topics. This is mainly a remnant of the first 2 years of DevStaff meetups when voting used to happen on GitHub. Some of our [community members](https://github.com/kabitakis/github-analytics/graphs/contributors) even open sourced [a tool for counting votes and :thumbsup: on GitHub issues](https://github.com/kabitakis/github-analytics) (either as reaction, or as comment, limiting to one per author). 


## How to start a Hack Session
Anyone can start a Hack Session. Here are some things to keep in mind:

* It's a good idea to have found at least one other interested member before opening an issue.
* The issue MUST contain:
  * 'hack session' in its title
  * A host
  * A proposed place
  * A proposed date
  * A limit on attendees (8 is a reasonable number to begin with)
  * Some prerequisites such as attendees experience, tools to be installed, tutorials to be followed before the session etc.

DevStaff will help in any way possible, e.g. meetup.com event, venue, catering, etc. depending on the availability, size, and needs.

## Community 
Please feel free to propose ANY changes you like to our community, to our workflow, to our meetups (location, setup, time / day of week, etc.) by opening an issue first, for discussion, and a PR including your proposed change, if applicable. This is an open community so all suggestions are welcome!! 
The maintainers are simply there to ensure the community guidelines are upheld and to ensure everything runs smoothly. 

## Repo Maintenance
Maintainers of this repo are required to uphold the 4-eyes principle. (No PR should get merged unless two maintainers have confirmed / given a :+1: )
