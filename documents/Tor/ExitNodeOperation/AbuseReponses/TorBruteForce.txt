We're sorry your account has been brute forced. We can try to prevent
our node from connecting to this site, but since the Tor network
has 800 or so exits, doing so wouldn't really stop the action long
term. The attacker would probably just chain an open proxy after Tor,
or just use open wireless and/or a proxy without Tor.

The Tor project does provide an automated DNSRBL for you to query to 
flag requests from Tor nodes as requiring special treatment:

In general, we believe that problems like this are best solved by
improving the service to defend against the attack from the Internet
at large rather than specifically tailoring behavior for Tor. Brute 
force login attempts can be reduced/slowed by captchas, which is the 
approach taken by Gmail for this same problem. In fact, Google
provides a free captcha service, complete with code for easy inclusion
in a number of systems to help other sites deal with this issue:
