The IP address in question is a Tor exit node.
https://www.torproject.org/overview.html

There is little we can do to trace this matter further. As can be seen
from the overview page, the Tor network is designed to make tracing of
users impossible. The Tor network is run by some 5000 volunteers who
use the free software provided by the Tor Project to run Tor routers.
Client connections are routed through multiple relays, and are
multiplexed together on the connections between relays. The system
does not record logs of client connections or previous hops.

This is because the Tor network is a censorship resistance, privacy,
and anonymity system used by whistle blowers, journalists, Chinese
dissidents skirting the Great Firewall, abuse victims, stalker
targets, the US military, and law enforcement, just to name a few.
See https://www.torproject.org/about/torusers.html.en for more info.

Unfortunately, some people misuse the network. However, compared to
the rate of legitimate use (the IP range in question processes nearly
a gigabit of traffic per second), abuse complaints are rare.
