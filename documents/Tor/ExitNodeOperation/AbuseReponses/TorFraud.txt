This also does not mean that there is nothing that can be done. For
serious incidents, traditional police work techniques of running
stings and investigating to determine means, motive, and opportunity
are still very effective.

Additionally, the Tor project provides an automated DNSRBL for you to
query to flag orders coming from Tor nodes as requiring special
review: https://www.torproject.org/tordnsel/

It also provides a Bulk Exit List service for retrieving the entire list:
https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py

You can use this list to help you take a closer look at Tor orders, or
to hold them temporarily for additional verification, without losing
legitimate customers.

In fact, in my experience, the fraud processing teams contracted by
many ISPs simply mark all requests from Tor nodes as fraud using that
very list. So it is even possible this is a legitimate order, but was
flagged as fraud solely based on IP, especially if you contract out
fraud detection to a third party.
