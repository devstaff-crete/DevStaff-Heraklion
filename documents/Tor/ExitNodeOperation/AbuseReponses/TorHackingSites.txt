This also does not mean that there is nothing that can be done. For
serious incidents, traditional police work techniques of running
stings and investigating to determine means, motive, and opportunity
are still very effective.

Additionally, the Tor project provides an automated DNSRBL for you to
query to flag visitors coming from Tor nodes as requiring special
treatment: https://www.torproject.org/tordnsel/. The same list is
available through the Tor Bulk Exit List:
https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py

However, rather than banning legitimate Tor users from using your
service in general, we recommend ensuring that such services are updated
and maintained to free of vulnerabilities that can lead to
situations such as this (PHP webshell/XSS compromise/SQL Injection 
compromise).
