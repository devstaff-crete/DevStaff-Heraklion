It appears that your specific abuse complaint was generated by an
authenticated Google groups user. Inspecting the headers reveals that
the abuse complaint address for Google Groups is
groups-abuse@google.com. Contacting this address will give you better
luck at actually having this abuser's Google Groups account canceled
than will chasing down Tor nodes, proxies, and open wireless access
points.

Additionally, if your news reader supports killfiles, you may be
interested in using the Tor Bulk Exit list script to download a list of
IPs to include in your killfile for posts that match "NTTP-Posting-Host:
