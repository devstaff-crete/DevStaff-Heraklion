With respect to your account, given that the attacker used Tor
and not a large botnet (or your machine's IP itself), it is likely
that your password was either harvested off of your machine from a
keylogger, or it was captured via a kiosk, or from open wireless.

Our recommendation is to treat this event as though there was a login
from an open wireless access point in your city. Reset your password,
and if you don't have antivirus already, download the free AVG:
http://free.avg.com/us-en/download, Spybot SD:
http://www.safer-networking.org/nl/home/index.html, and/or AdAware:
http://www.lavasoft.com/?domain=lavasoftusa.com. Use these to scan to
check for keyloggers or spyware that someone with access to your
computer may have installed.

To help protect yourself while using open wireless, consider using this
Firefox plugin: https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere/ and encourage the
site maintainer to support https logins.
