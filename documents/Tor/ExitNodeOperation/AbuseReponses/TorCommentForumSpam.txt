This does not mean that nothing can be done, however.

The Tor project provides an automated DNSRBL for you to query to flag 
posts coming from Tor nodes as requiring special review. You can also
use this DNSRBL to only allow Tor IPs to read but not
post comments. https://www.torproject.org/tordnsel/

However, be aware that this may be just one jerk amongst many
legitimate Tor users who use your forums. You might have luck getting
rid of this jerk by temporarily limiting account creation to require
gmail accounts before posting, or by requiring account creation be
done over non-Tor before posting.

In general, we believe that problems like this are best solved by 
improving your service to defend against the attack from the Internet
at large.  Brute force login attempts can be reduced/slowed by
captchas, which is the approach taken by Gmail for this same problem.
In fact, Google provides a free captcha service, complete with code
for easy inclusion in a number of systems to help other sites deal
with this issue: https://code.google.com/apis/recaptcha/intro.html
