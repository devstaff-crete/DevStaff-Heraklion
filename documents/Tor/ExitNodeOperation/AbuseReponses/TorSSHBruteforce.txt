If you are concerned about SSH scans, you might consider running your
SSHD on a port other than the default of 22. Many worms, scanners, and
botnets scan the entire Internet looking for SSH logins. The fact that
a few logins happened to come from Tor is likely a small blip on your
overall login attempt rate. You might also consider a rate limiting
solution:

If it is in fact a serious problem specific to Tor, the Tor project
provides an automated DNSRBL for you to query to block login attempts
coming from Tor nodes: https://www.torproject.org/tordnsel/

It is also possible to download a list of all Tor exit IPs that will
connect to your SSH port:
https://check.torproject.org/cgi-bin/TorBulkExitList.py?ip=YOUR_IP&port=22

You can use this list to create iptables rules to block the network. 
However, we still recommend using the general approach, as the attack 
will likely simply reappear from an open proxy or other IP once Tor 
is blocked.
