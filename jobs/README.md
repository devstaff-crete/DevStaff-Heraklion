## Software-Developer PHP / Symfony
 (Biel/Switzerland) @ [Integrated Scientific Services AG](https://www.iss-ag.ch)

We are looking for a PHP developer with hands-on experience and an object oriented way of thinking. We have been implementing projects using Symfony for a while now (version 1/2/3/4) so exposure to the framework would be an important advantage. Since we are talking about developement of web applications, CSS/Javascript/HTML knowledge is expected as well.

* Working on site is expected, Biel is a lovely and lively little city in the center of Switzerland, well connected with 4 major swiss cities (Zürich, Bern, Basel, Geneva) and 3 international airports (Zurich, Basel, Geneva).
* Working knowledge of German is a big advantage and willingness to pick it up will be well supported by us. English should be there both in speaking and writing adequately, in case German is missing.
* Remote work is not our preferred option, should the right person show up however, we would be willing to consider an arrangement that works for both sides without a big overhead.

For informal inquiries you can contact me (stefanos.petrakis@iss-ag.ch)
