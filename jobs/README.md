## Βlockchain / Smart contract Engineer (Remote)

Good evening!

I ([maninak](https://app.slack.com/client/T06RGB4BU/C06RGB4DQ/user_profile/U2F3S7MMW)) am forwarding a job listing for a friend and colleague based in London. From what I understand it's about a promising new project in the crypto space, for which an international team is being set up and with some big names in the industry behind it, therefore it's a bit hush-hush in the beginning, hence the brief listing.

> We are looking for developers with experience in web3 projects and knowledge of ETH/Solidity, smart contracts and Solana/Rust (optional).
>Information: kon@codica.net

For any inquiries, please contact Konstantinos (he is Greek BTW). I know he will be happy to explain more when you reach out to him and there's no need to do the official job application thing from the very first email.
