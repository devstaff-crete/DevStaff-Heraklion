## Research Intern @ Cisco
In this internship with the BGP research group, you get to study how BGP is used in the real world and develop algorithms, analyses, and tools that improve understanding of how networks interconnect and how to better protect this critical Internet infrastructure.

As an intern, you’ll work on concrete, open-ended research problems. You’ll use statistics, data science, and AI/ML techniques to analyze large-scale BGP data, characterize routing behavior and dynamics, and prototype algorithms that advance understanding of Internet topology and interconnection.

Throughout the internship, you’ll collaborate closely with experienced researchers, engineers, and product partners. You’ll be mentored by a dedicated researcher and own a well-scoped project, and see your work progress from exploration and prototyping toward solutions that can influence solutions and products used by large enterprises and network operators.

This internship is designed to be hands-on, impactful, and fast-moving, with a strong emphasis on learning, experimentation, and turning research ideas into practical solutions. In addition to influencing production systems, your work will contribute to internal research artifacts, technical reports, and research publications. ThousandEyes BGP Research team frequently presents at leading community and academic venues such as NANOG, RIPE, and IMC.
