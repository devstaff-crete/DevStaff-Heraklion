# Hack Sessions
DevStaff members occasionally organise Hack Sessions on various topics. 
Org Team will help with great pleasure to organize a Hack Session and create 
an event on meetup.com for the session!

## How to Start a Hack Session
Anyone can start a Hack Session! It's a good idea to have found at least 
one other interested member before opening an issue. The issue MUST contain:
* 'hack session' in its title
* A host (you?)
* A proposed place
* A proposed date
* A limit on attendees
* Some prerequisites such as attendees experience, tools to be installed, 
tutorials to be followed before the session etc.

### Hints
* 8 attendees/laptops is good limit to start. Above this limit, you need more 
  advanced organisational level, more strict planning, create groups, more 
  facilitators etc.
* Keep it at least 3-4 hours long, or it may be unproductive
* At the first session we worked on 7 Digital Ocean VMs and we experienced no 
  network issues
* Create a Slack channel and add the participants! You need to share data quickly
* It helps (a lot) to have a whiteboard and a projector/large screen
* It helps (a lot) to everybody have done their homework (examples, tutorials 
  etc). Prerequisites are important for the success of the session!
