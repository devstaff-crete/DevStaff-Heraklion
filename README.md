## A Developer Community in Crete

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a583b7764bab09a8ffc0/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion/maintainability)

There's a lot of us, devs, here in Crete. Yet, we hardly ever get together in large groups, or even know each other – somewhat strange for our small community, we hope you'll agree. This group is an attempt at bringing us all together for informal chats about what we're all passionate about: technology and software. Join the meetup, learn, teach, speak your mind, sharpen your skills, share the knowledge and help us build a community where devs can openly exchange ideas!

* **Don't know where to start?** Are you new to git and MeetUp? Here is a short intro about the tools we use: [Start Here!](StartHere.md)

* **You just want to join the group?** Great!
  Join our [MeetUp group](http://www.meetup.com/DevStaff-A-Developer-Community-Gathering-In-Crete/) or find us live on: [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/devstaff/shared_invite/enQtNDYyNTI0NjUyMjczLWUyN2ZkOGJjYWQyMzU2MTE0MjViYTAxYWYxMjVlMzk2ZDk1N2I3ZGI2Y2MxMmMwN2JkNzY5MGUzMGRmN2NlNWM)

## Org Meetups

An org meetup is a simple get-together, **open to every member of our community** who would like to contribute / discuss some organizational issues, future topics etc. Also a good opportunity to chat about all-things-tech :)

DevStaff is an open community. Open, as in Open Source. If you don't like anything about the community you can change it! 

_Hint: Decisions are made in Org Meetups ;)_

The [documents section](https://github.com/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion/tree/master/documents) contains a list of general purpose documents (e.g. legal, business, presentations, etc.) that DevStaff members have freely shared to be used by others in the community. Sharing is caring, so please open a PR with any documents you might have that you feel other DevStaff members could use!
