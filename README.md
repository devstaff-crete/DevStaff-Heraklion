## Org Meetups

An org meetup is a simple get-together, **open to every member of our community** who would like to contribute / discuss some organizational issues, future topics etc. Also a good opportunity to chat about all-things-tech :)

DevStaff is an open community. Open, as in Open Source. If you don't like anything about the community you can change it! 

_Hint: Decisions are taken in Org Meetups ;) _

## Shared Documents :book:

The [documents section](https://github.com/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion/tree/master/documents) contains a list of general purpose documents (e.g. legal, business, presentations, etc.) that DevStaff members have freely shared to be used by others in the community. Sharing is caring, so please open a PR with any documents you might have that you feel other DevStaff members could use!

## Chat Rooms :speech_balloon:

The community uses a few different chatrooms based on [Slack](https://devstaff.slack.com/signup). Use one of them to contact us!
