## A Developer Community in Crete

[![Maintainability](https://api.codeclimate.com/v1/badges/a583b7764bab09a8ffc0/maintainability)](https://codeclimate.com/github/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion/maintainability)

There's a lot of us, devs, here in Crete. Yet, we hardly ever get together in
large groups, or even know each other – somewhat strange for our small
community, we hope you'll agree. This group is an attempt at bringing us all
together for informal chats about what we're all passionate about: technology
and software. Join the meetup, learn, teach, speak your mind, sharpen your
skills, share the knowledge and help us build a community where devs can openly
exchange ideas!

* **Don't know where to start?** Are you new to git and MeetUp? Here is a short intro about the tools we use: [Start Here!](StartHere.md)

## Projects :construction:

developed by DevStaff Members. You can add your own by sending us a Pull
Request.

## Job Postings :postal_horn:

Check the [job openings](jobs/README.md), posted by DevStaff members. You can

## Org Meetups

An org meetup is a simple get-together, **open to every member of our
community**, who would like to contribute / discuss some organizational issues,
future topics etc. Also a good opportunity to chat about all-things-tech :)

DevStaff is an open community. Open, as in Open Source. If you don't like
something about the community you can change it!

_Hint: Decisions are made in Org Meetups ;)_

## Shared Documents :book:

The [documents section](documents) contains a list of general purpose documents
(e.g. legal, business, presentations, etc.) that DevStaff members have freely
shared to be used by others in the community. Sharing is caring, so please open
a PR with any documents you might have that you feel other DevStaff members
could use!
