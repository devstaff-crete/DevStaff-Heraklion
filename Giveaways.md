# Giveaways
From time to time DevStaff has the opportunity to offer some giveaways during the meetups. The prizes are provided by [sponsors](https://github.com/devstaff-crete/DevStaff-Heraklion/blob/master/Sponsors.md) in return of advertising.

The process, the tools and the rules we use for these giveaways are described here:.

# Prizes list
All prizes will be written down at each meetup's announcement at [meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/devstaff/). Moreover, at the intro presentation, when sponsors are presented, each prize will be explicitly mentioned as far as the type, the amount of prizes and the sponsor of each one.

# Participants eligibility
All participants of a meetup are eligible for the raffling process including the speaker(s), attendees, and org team members. Org team member's that attend the meetup (we prefer to provide more prizes to the community and have a chance to win them rather than benefit things as org teams members 😉), speaker(s) as well as meetup's attendees will participate in the raffling process. The participants of a meetup are the members that have joined our meetup's place (in case of physical meetups) or our communication tool (in case of remote meetups).

# Raffle Process
During the meetup (especially during the intro and at the closing phase) a link (to Google Forms) will be shared where everyone present will be able to add their name & email in order to participate to the raffling process. A number will be assigned to each participant's entry and then we shall use the [random.org](https://www.random.org/) to generate one number per giveaway prize. The list with the participants alongside the assigned unique number will be presented before the giveaway begins. Each participant's unique number corresponding to the random number produced will win the prize. All prizes will be given in the order mentioned at the top of the page in the provided link where participants will fill theirs details.

The whole raffle process described at this step will take place during the end of the meetup (live or) in front of all participants.
